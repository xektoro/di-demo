# YAML is often used to describe data structures and we can do that this way:

#single property
name: Dimitar

# array of properties (YAML) is very sensitive about spacing (here we have 2 spaces)
names:
  - Uliana

# here we have escaped comment sign
pound_sign: "#"

book:

# boolean values
truth: yes
another_truth: True
more_truth: true
lie: no
lie2: No
lie3: false
lie4: FALSE

# This is string (escaped)
string_val: "This is it's quote"
colon_string: "my courses: one two three"

# it will read everything, also the new lines
include_new_lines: |
  wqeqwrqwr
  eqwe qweqweqw
  qweqweqwe qweqweqweq

# now the new lines will be ignored and we will have one long string, contatining all that characters
ignore_new_lines: >
